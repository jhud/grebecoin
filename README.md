# grebecoin
A cryptocurrency that I'm making to learn about cryptocurrencies. It's going to be written in Python, be easy to understand, and open source.

It will have a magical lucky token and I'll send you a grebe t-shirt if you mine it and take you down to the lake, buy you a coffee, and show you the Great Crested Grebes.

If you want to join the ICO, send me bitcoins.
