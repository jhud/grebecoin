# grebecoin
A cryptocurrency that I'm making to learn about cryptocurrencies. It's going to be written in Python, be easy to understand, and open source.

It will have a magical lucky token and I'll send you a grebe t-shirt if you mine it and take you down to the lake, buy you a coffee, and show you the Great Crested Grebes.

If you want to join the ICO, send me bitcoins.

# GETTING STARTED
To make a new wallet, run "python wallet.py". Your private key is in "private.pem" - do not share this with anyone! Someone will have access to all your funds if they have this. Store it on a USB key for extra security.
